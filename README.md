# GameDesigning
Worked on setting up different models for Multimedia project. Used unity for designing.

Unity always has been used for the game development but it has been used as a multimedia element as graphic and designing in 3D.
Firstly, starting with the opening of the game the directional light needs to be adjusted in such a way that sun sets in that direction. Then come the wind which has been set in favour of Patagonia because its my gameplay destination.

Coming to asset that I used externally :
Terrain: the adjustment of coordinates and cordially with light and the size of the terrain. Lowering or highering of terrain on sides is done by first option. Secondly the terrain textures have been imported from environment package in unity using the stony road, green patches and brown soil for trees and forests
Car :  white colour, steering angle : 25 and limit of speed 300 -1000 km/hr and mass from 2000 â€“ 6000kgs has been set for the real time use of cars and real feel of cars. Cars have proper brakes with scripted option of kinematic, gravity and finally in motion in features.
Lampost and benches : Lampost with multilamps has been imported from assets and also the colour has been set up according to the environment. Collision with the lamppost is all scripted with proper imaging of light intensity in night time.
Road blockers : Black and yellow combination road blockers have been properly adjusted for blocking the road because they might be dangerous during apocylase due to landsliding in the forsests.

House : Bhutan fam house assest has been imported with all features of collision and also the pavement of houses with proper orientation of trees in between every house for partiotioning has been done properly with all mounted lights scripted with different styles of houses ranging from brown to golden with balcony and big house to villa.

Tree : conifer,deciduous and palm have been imported because of Patagonia being rich in these trees. Also Trees placing in forests and housing with collisison detector and 3D view of leaves has been done using scripting language c#, All terrains have been covered with trees for denser look at apoyclaspe and also the boundary specification is done with different heights of trees and with different types.

Bridge : color of stone , with diff angles tilted ,to visualise the broken bridge in apocylcse and blocking the path too   has been enabled.
Camera : car sterrring has been coordinated with that of camera by using the rotational and positional features to place car with exact camera element.
Wall : An invisible wall is there which is sign for showing that u entered the house and also u have exited terrain with proper scripting and game controller options is there.
Water splash : as soon as car goes through water , water splashes thus giving real look and trees have grown there as in wild life forests.
Shadow casting : due to directional light the shadow has been casted depending on direction thus giving it a real look.
3D Text : reach home is too declare the start point of the area where it indicates the mission of the game initially. The text Is bold and arial and italics with huge font size and also positioning of z axis in such a way that it always is visible on start is essential.
Railway godown : the railway workshop and compartment has been set up along the road to give a feel of how imp it become when apocylape occurs and every shipment becomes necessary.

Gameplay : person is stuck in Patagonia and city will be sudffering from apolycase in like 1 day ahead. So the person  needs to get the essentilss from house as soon as possible but has lost due to damage occurred he has to follow new path unknown to him to reach his house. Characersitics of house are described as long house with two street lights and long road insise near brigde. After this he need to get out of the city and only way left is forest and thus goes thorught forest and finishes thus going in diff terrain.
